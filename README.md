# entity-db

Entity-db provides a JSON API to manage database schema and perform CRUD operations on entities.
It is written in Clojure on top of

* [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com) - it's a NoSQL database with very rich modelling/querying capabilities
* [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) - a minimalistic web routing library for JSON Web API
* [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure) - Web server interface library (similar to [Rack](http://rack.github.io/)
